## General Introduction

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

**Recycling** has always been an intersting problem as it involves so many different waste materials that contibute to this problem. First, we are all consumers and unfortunately only **some** of the consumer population show an interest in recycling. One aspect of recycling that I want to address is how to make recycling more convenient for the everyday household person. If we can figure out a way to make it more convenient it may promote better recycling habits. For example: a busy household may find it inconvenient to sort recyclable materials. Therefore, they may toss together recycable materials with non-recyclable materials because of the extra effort it takes to go through and sort the differences. The problem may be due to timing and convenience. How much time does it take to sort through recyclable and non-recyclable waste? Recycling dates back to the colonial era, this is because new materials were difficult to come by so they had to repurpose used materials. There are proposed solutions for recycling. However, even with the proposed solutions, there is still a vast amount of household that do not recycle.

## Requirements (Experimental Design)



**Hypothesis:**

**Null hypothesis:**

**Independent variables:**

**Dependent variables:**


(remove: You should start by specifying a set of requirements. I specified a topic Smart Cities but what exactly does that mean-  you should practice formulating your own set of requirements and an experiment. Define a hypothesis of a problem cities face and how a smart city would possibly help alleviate this issue. This helps you think about your problem communication and system objectives inputs, functions, and outputs - they should be clearly specified.)


## Smart City (My Problem) Model

(remove: add a high-level overview of your model, the part below should link to the model directory markdown files)
(remove: Look at the [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) for how to structure this part of Part 2 for each diagram. Only the Object diagram has the template, the rest are blank. )

* [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) - provides the high level overview of components
* [**Class Diagram**](model/class_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Behavior Diagram**](model/behavior_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Agent / User case** (if appropriate)](model/agent_usecase_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)

## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

(remove: for part 3 add two to three sentences here and link the [**(your own name)**](model/README.md) file in the analysis folder - which describe how you would simulate this - type of simulation, rough details -inputs, outputs - how it will help you analyze your experimental hypothesis, or nullify your null hypothesis.)

[**Code template**](code/README.md) - Starting coding framework for the (insert your exact problem here.)

## **P**ortable **O**rganic **T**rouble-free **S**elf-watering System (**POTS**) Model
Here [**we provide an overview**](code/POTS_system/README.md) of the **P**ortable **O**rganic **T**rouble-free **S**elf-watering System (**POTS**) Model and provide a source code template.
