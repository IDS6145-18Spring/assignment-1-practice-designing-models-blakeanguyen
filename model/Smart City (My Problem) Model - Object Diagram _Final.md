## Smart City (My Problem) Model - Object Diagram


Recyclebot has two classifications non-recycable waste and recycable materials. The robot classifies items such as lightbulbs, perishable items (i.e. fruits and meats), and air filters as non-recycable. The robot will then proceed to dispose of the non-recycable items. The robot will take recycable materials such as plastic, paper, and metal and cycle the materials through a repurposing process to create new materials.
