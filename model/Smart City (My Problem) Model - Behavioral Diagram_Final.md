## Smart City (My Problem) Model - Behavioral Diagram



The behavioral diagram depicts the behaviors of Recyclebot. In the diagram below, you notice that the process initates with collecting waste and recycable materials. Then it proceeds to sort non-recycable waste and recycable materials. The class is associated to two classifications labeled as non-recycable, which proceeds to destroy or properly dispose of the non-recycable waste such as perishable foods such as fruits and meats. The other classification labeled recycable materials proceeds to the process of repurposing materials to ultimately compose new materials from recycled materials.
